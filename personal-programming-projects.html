      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I started this project my sophmore year of high school while taking introductory chemistry and exploring the
        basics of Python programming.
        I recognized that the tedious adding of element masses was something that could be easily done by a computer
        program.
        My first program was quite rudimentary, as I had minimal programming skills at the time.
        It required very specific input and calculations took a long time to enter.
        After several years of teaching myself Python, I decided to revisit the program and add string parsing to make
        input easier.
        Now the user enters the chemical formula of a compound as it would appear in the standard notation.
        The program parses the string into individual elements and considers the subscripts that follow to calculate the
        total atomic mass of the compound.
        While I no longer have as much use for something that does these calculations, the project was an excellent
        exercise in working with strings and parsing out useful information.
      </p>
      <h3>Improvements in Future Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Increased data accuracy:</b> I did not concern myself too much with the accuracy of the values assigned
          to the elements. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project was a small effort to visualize the potential outcomes of grades in my first semester classes using
        the information that I know.
        The university online grade system, if set up improperly by the professor, does not truly reflect the grade
        achieved under the weights provided on the syllabus.
        I also desired the ability to see how any grade on the remainder of class material would affect my total class
        score and recieved grade.
        The program takes input from a loop, asking for points earned, total points possible, and the weight such points
        have on my grade.
        If 100% of the grades are entered it gives a final score.
        If the user indicates that they are done, it iterates over each percentage of the remaining points to be earned
        and displays final grades.
        The program is not without bugs, but it was a short project that worked for my needs and will be used in later
        semesters to gain insight into how I am performing in a class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this program is not optimized, it is not recommended for use unless the code is read and understood!
        There are specific data entry protocols that are not protected from entry errors.
      </p>
      <h3>Improvements in Future Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Increased input flexibility:</b> Input currently must be entered in a very specific way, and bad input
          could result in errors. Given that I forsee this program only being used by myself, I see no need to add
          looser input standards or make input easier.</li>
        <li><b>Cleaner user interface:</b> It would be nice to have a professional looking GUI if this is something that
          is undergoing consistent use.</li>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by an activity performed in the "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas
        which I worked through over the course of four months in an effort to extend my knowledge of python into deeper
        and more applicable subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The activity involved using Numpy methods to calculate the distance between points. Given that the Coronavirus
        outbreak was in full swing and social distancing was a topic discussed at length, I figured an interesting
        extension of the activity would be a disease spread simulation. The program randomly generates N points and
        constructs an NxN matrix with the distance between any two points. One point is assigned an infected tag, and
        the probability of spread is determined by the distance between points through a variable map. I had not covered
        Matplotlib at the time of exploring this project, but I managed to string together functional visualization
        tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The variable map related to the distance between points was rudimentarily experimented with, and the
        program showed that reduced contact reduced exponential growth significantly. Small changes in the map resulted
        in dramatic effects in the ability for the infection to spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this project was rather simple and somewhat underdeveloped, it was an excellent exercise in working with
        Numpy that will no doubt come in handy for future projects. I also see this program as having very high
        potential for expansion as my skills with Matplotlib, machine learning, and general statistics develop.
      </p>
      <h3>Improvements in Future Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>More powerful visualization tools:</b> The extent to which I implemented visualization tools was in the
          "real-time" view of the spread. A necessary addition would be the implementation of visuals that represent the
          simulation as a whole to give insight into the bigger picture and "flattening the curve".
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Addition of death and max care capacity:</b> The current program assigns points three states: uninfected,
          infected, and recovered. A nice touch would be adding a permanent death state to those who do not recieve
          "care" because too many points are infected at once. This would make the spread more reflective of an actual
          pandemic situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Adaptive spread function:</b> The ability for the program to look at current and past data to refine and
          adapt the implemented variables would be a very cool feature and excellent exploration of machine learning
          techniques.
        </li>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project was pursued out of a deep interest in music and a desire for accompanying visual stimuli in the
        form of a reactive LED strip. I saw a video on audio processing with Python and became fixated on making such a
        desire a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program samples the audio from the Stero Mix on my computer, allowing for any audio source (Spotify,
        YouTube,
        etc.) to be used. A Fourier Transform is applied to the waveform to produce data about the dominant frequency
        present in the sound. I was then able to use the data I produced to create a variety of color mappings to send
        over serial connection to a microcontroller where the signal is sent to an LED strip.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I have designed two quality, useable mappings with an ability to easily expand and create more. One of
        these uses the dominant frequency to map to a value on a Red to Blue color spectrum. The other uses the value of
        the dominant frequency to change the brightness of the LEDs in a cycling color wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lot of room for expansion of this project as I become more familiar with higher level programming and
        I have a lot of ideas for interesting color mapping techniques. I will be implementing this in my apartment in
        August, and, as a result, will need to become familiar with power distribution in order to create a safe,
        effective product.
      </p>

      <h3>Improvements in Future Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>More color Mappings:</b> I want to pull from dominant frequency, change in dominant frequency, change in
          overall transform, and sound intensity to create a variety of unique color mappings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Make program cleaner as I learn about and understand an object-oriented approach:</b> Given the nature of
          the program, a more modular system would make implementing new features easier. I want to eventually have the
          mappings as their own distinct classes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User interface for easy mapping change:</b> A nice GUI for ease of use and user abstraction would be an
          important implementation for a more quality program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Language change:</b> Python is not the most ideal language to use for this application, as the quality of
          the program is very dependent on being able to sample fast and often. I would at some point like to make a
          full switch to C++ or Java in hopes that it will make a more responsive program. There are noticeable moments
          where the program misses a base drop; this could be a bug in how I am sampling or a fundamental issue with
          using the Python language. I suspect the later.
