      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This was my first college design project, and compared to my peers, I would say that mine was well constructed
        and a bold shot at something unique. ME201 was an introductory class to give students a taste of what mechanical
        engineering is about. As a result, the turbine project was performed without knowledge of concepts fundamental
        to turbine design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my peers took an approach centered around catching the wind. While effective, I wanted to break from the
        standard approach and do things differently. In the initial research of common designs, a bladed design was a
        common occurence and I sought to explore such an approach.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        I 3D printed the blades in vase mode to make them as light as possible, used thin wooden plates for the ends,
        and designed clips for the ability to change the number and angle of the blades. One of the project requirements
        was having variables that are changed between designs. Most people made four designs to accomodate two
        variables, but I made one, universal design to cut material costs. In all, the project was less than a dollar
        because we used scrap material and older filament that would otherwise go unused.
      </p>
      <p>
        The turbine ended up being only moderately efficient compared to my fellow classmates, but I'm glad my project
        wasn't excessively expensive and got the job done.

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        ME231 was a fun little class to take that furthered and solidified my experience with 3D modeling and design. A
        long time ago, I saw the Strandbeest mechanism by Theo Jansen and knew at some point I would make one. The
        required project for this class was the construction of an existing mechanism which was perfect for me to
        finally build a Strandbeest mechanism. While I considered making the whole walking structure, such a pursuit was
        above and beyond the requirements, so I kept it simple and made one leg. I modeled and printed the parts and
        fixed them together with M4 screws and nuts. The first time I produced the design, I found that I failed to
        consider the height of the screws in the design. This was easily accomodated with minor file adjustments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final piece was as captivating as I imagined. At some point I also constructed the assembly of the full
        structure with offset leg cycles in SolidWorks because it was a slight project extension and totally worth the
        effort.
