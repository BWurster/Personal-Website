            "overview":["This project was done for a friend of mine whose garage door opener housing broke. He had initially contacted the garage door opener company to get it fixed but was advised to just buy a new one. To him, this seemed like a waste of perfectly functional electronics, so he asked me, knowing that I had a 3D printer and proficient 3D modeling skills, to design and manufacture a new case. I made a base design that met basic functionality standards; however, this lacked uniqueness and the utilization of rapid custom prototyping that 3D printing opens the door to. I asked if he wanted any unique elements to be added, and after some thought he settled on a Supreme branded garage door opener. I added the logo to the design and went the extra mile to paint it bright red in the standard Supreme fashion. Overall, this was an excellent little project to practice meeting the design contraints imparted not only by the manufacturer of the initial garage door opener but also by the intended client."],

Now the user enters the chemical formula of a compound as it would appear in the standard notation. The program parses the string into individual elements and considers the subscripts that follow to calculate the total atomic mass of the compound.

                "This project was pursued out of a deep interest in music and a desire for accompanying visual stimuli in the form of a reactive LED strip. I saw a video on audio processing with Python and became fixated on making such a desire a reality.",
                "The program samples the audio from the Stero Mix on my computer, allowing for any audio source (Spotify,etc.) to be used. A Fourier Transform is applied to the waveform to produce data about the dominant frequency present in the sound. I was then able to use the data I produced to create a variety of color mappings to send over serial connection to a microcontroller where the signal is sent to an LED strip.",
                "So far, I have designed two quality, useable mappings with an ability to easily expand and create more. One of these uses the dominant frequency to map to a value on a Red to Blue color spectrum. The other uses the value of the dominant frequency to change the brightness of the LEDs in a cycling color wheel.",
                "There is a lot of room for expansion of this project as I become more familiar with higher level programming and I have a lot of ideas for interesting color mapping techniques. I will be implementing this in my apartment in August, and, as a result, will need to become familiar with power distribution in order to create a safe, effective product."

                "Make program cleaner as I learn about and understand an object-oriented approach":"Given the nature of the program, a more modular system would make implementing new features easier. I want to eventually have the mappings as their own distinct classes.",
                "User interface for easy mapping change":"A nice GUI for ease of use and user abstraction would be an important implementation for a more quality program.",
                "Language change":"Python is not the most ideal language to use for this application, as the quality of the program is very dependent on being able to sample fast and often. I would at some point like to full switch to C++ or Java in hopes that it will make a more responsive program. There are noticeable moments where the program misses a base drop; this could be a bug in how I am sampling or a fundamental issue with using the Python language. I suspect the later."

As you can see, it is, standalone, a beautiful painting, but I believe that quality art must be displayed with quality in mind, so I envisioned a backlighting system to not only complement the art, but to add ambiance and mood-lighting to the room.",
                "The painting was programmed with a variety of static and variable color modes, and the hardware consists of an Arduino Nano, LED strip, potentiometer to control brightness, and a button to cycle through modes. I 3D printed offsets with the dual purpose of giving the electronics adaquate mounting space and to provide drop so the light can be radiated from the edge.",
                "The project as a whole came together really nicely, and there are not any changes I would make. If I were to do the project again, I would probably order a custom PCB to get experience with such a process instead of soldering togther my own. It is a bit unfortunate that there is a wire coming out of the painting to receive power, but given the permanent nature of the installation and the many LEDs, battery power would have drained fast, required maintenence, and needed many batteries to operate."
