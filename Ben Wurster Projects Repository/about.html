        <p>
          My name is Ben Wurster and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing degrees
          in
          Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. Making stuff, asking questions, and
          exploring
          the fundamental nature of the world around us has always driven me to excel academically and find passion in
          doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I would consider myself to be an extremely active, wholesome-lifestyle person who actively
          seeks out new experiences and personal growth. Every day is an opportunity to become better and enjoy the
          limited time one has. Beyond this extensive repository of projects, I seek to maintain an active social life,
          prioritizing family and friends above all else. They are a source of creative inspiration that tethers me to a
          hunger for being the best me I can be every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may have already noticed, most of my personal design projects are focused on highlights of popular
          culture or improving the failures or shortcomings of existing products. These are deep motivations of mine
          because they always seem to make those around me happy. We can all connect through popular culture, and we all
          hate when things fall apart or have the potential to be better. I hope to continue to derive joy from such
          projects moving into the future as I seek to attain and apply greater knowledge and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to my limited exposure to higher level classes while in school, my student projects may appear rather
          empty.
          This is not due to a lack of engagement but to the fact that the projects I have done have not been of my own
          intellectual conception. I will most certainly have more projects occupying that space as I emerge into higher
          level classes. For the moment though, feel free to note the depth and abundance of my independent projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a final note, if you are reading this page, I want to thank you for taking the time to peruse my passionate
          pursuits over the years. I have had a lot of fun making many of these projects and it is nice to have them
          seen by anyone who is interested. Feel free to connect with me through the button in the upper right for any
          matters related to site quality, professional inquiries, etc.
